# Feed Me!

What started as a challenge project in a Microsoft course.  This is a small console based game where the player moves around the screen using the arrow
keys on the keyboard and consumes food that appears in random locations on the screen. The type of food changes the status of the player and this is 
shown by changing the player's image.
